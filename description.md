# Authentication Service Implementation

This document explains the step-by-step process of implementing the authentication service between the frontend React application and the backend Django API.

## Overview

The authentication system uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication between the frontend and backend. The implementation follows these key principles:

1. **Token-based authentication**: Using JWT tokens stored in HTTP-only cookies
2. **Context-based state management**: Using React Context API to manage authentication state
3. **Protected routes**: Implementing route protection for authenticated users
4. **Error handling**: Comprehensive error handling on both frontend and backend

## Backend Implementation

### 1. Django REST Framework with JWT

The backend uses Django REST Framework with `djangorestframework-simplejwt` for JWT token generation and validation.

#### Key Components:

- **Custom Token Views**: Extended the default JWT views to handle cookie-based token storage
- **User Model**: Custom user model with username, email, and password fields
- **Serializers**: For user registration and data validation
- **Views**: API endpoints for login, registration, logout, and token refresh

### 2. Authentication Flow

1. **Registration**:
   - User submits registration form with username, email, and password
   - Backend validates data and creates a new user
   - Returns success message or validation errors

2. **Login**:
   - User submits credentials (username and password)
   - Backend validates credentials and generates JWT tokens
   - Tokens are stored in HTTP-only cookies for security
   - Returns success response with user data

3. **Token Refresh**:
   - Frontend automatically refreshes access token using refresh token
   - Backend validates refresh token and issues new access token
   - New token is stored in HTTP-only cookie

4. **Logout**:
   - User requests logout
   - Backend invalidates tokens by clearing cookies
   - Returns success response

## Frontend Implementation

### 1. Authentication Context

The frontend uses React Context API to manage authentication state across the application.

#### Key Components:

- **AuthContext**: Provides authentication state and methods to all components
- **AuthProvider**: Wraps the application and provides authentication context
- **useAuth Hook**: Custom hook for accessing authentication context

### 2. API Service

A dedicated service for handling API requests to the backend.

#### Key Features:

- **Axios Instance**: Configured with credentials and base URL
- **Interceptors**: For handling token refresh and error responses
- **API Methods**: For login, registration, logout, and token refresh

### 3. Protected Routes

Routes that require authentication are protected using a wrapper component.

#### Implementation:

- **ProtectedRoute Component**: Checks if user is authenticated
- **Redirect Logic**: Redirects to login page if not authenticated
- **Loading State**: Handles loading state during authentication check

## Step-by-Step Authentication Flow

### Registration Process:

1. User fills out registration form with required information
2. Frontend validates form data
3. Frontend sends registration request to backend API
4. Backend validates data and creates new user
5. Frontend receives success response and redirects to login page
6. User can now log in with their credentials

### Login Process:

1. User enters username and password
2. Frontend sends login request to backend API
3. Backend validates credentials and generates JWT tokens
4. Tokens are stored in HTTP-only cookies
5. Frontend receives success response with user data
6. AuthContext updates with user information
7. User is redirected to homepage

### Protected Route Access:

1. User attempts to access a protected route
2. ProtectedRoute component checks authentication state
3. If authenticated, renders the requested component
4. If not authenticated, redirects to login page

### Token Refresh Process:

1. Frontend detects expired access token
2. Axios interceptor catches 401 Unauthorized response
3. Frontend sends refresh token request to backend
4. Backend validates refresh token and issues new access token
5. New token is stored in HTTP-only cookie
6. Original request is retried with new token

### Logout Process:

1. User clicks logout button
2. Frontend sends logout request to backend
3. Backend clears authentication cookies
4. Frontend clears authentication state
5. User is redirected to login page

## Security Considerations

1. **HTTP-Only Cookies**: Prevents JavaScript access to tokens, protecting against XSS attacks
2. **CSRF Protection**: Django's built-in CSRF protection
3. **Secure Password Storage**: Passwords are hashed using Django's password hashing
4. **Token Expiration**: Short-lived access tokens with refresh capability
5. **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation on both frontend and backend

## Error Handling

1. **Form Validation**: Client-side validation for immediate feedback
2. **API Error Responses**: Structured error responses from backend
3. **User Feedback**: Clear error messages displayed to users
4. **Network Error Handling**: Graceful handling of network issues
5. **Token Expiration**: Automatic token refresh when possible

## Conclusion

This authentication implementation provides a secure, user-friendly authentication system that follows best practices for web applications. The separation of concerns between frontend and backend, combined with proper error handling and security measures, creates a robust authentication service.
